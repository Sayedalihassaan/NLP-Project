# Sentiment Analysis Project

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive Sentiment Analysis application built to analyze text data and classify sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral. It leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models to process datasets, train models, and provide an interactive interface for users to input text and receive sentiment predictions. The project is structured with a modular backend, frontend, and supporting scripts, making it scalable and easy to maintain.

Features

Text Preprocessing: Cleans and preprocesses text data for analysis (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization).
Sentiment Classification: Uses machine learning models to predict sentiment (positive, negative, neutral).
Interactive Frontend: A user-friendly interface built with Streamlit for real-time sentiment analysis.
Modular Backend: Flask-based API for handling model inference and data processing.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Jupyter notebooks for dataset exploration and visualization.
Customizable: Easily extendable for new datasets or models.
Environment Management: Includes .env.example and requirements.txt for reproducibility.

Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/Sayedalihassaan/Sentiment-Analysis-Project.git
cd Sentiment-Analysis-Project


Set Up a Virtual Environment:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


Install Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt


Configure Environment Variables:

Copy .env.example to .env:cp .env.example .env


Update .env with your configurations (e.g., API keys, paths).


Download Datasets:

Place your datasets in the DataSets/ folder or update paths in the configuration.



Usage

Run the Backend:Start the Flask API server:
python backend.py

The API will be available at http://localhost:5000.

Run the Frontend:Launch the Streamlit app:
streamlit run frontend.py

Access the interface at http://localhost:8501.

Interact with the Application:

Use the Streamlit interface to input text and view sentiment predictions.
Explore API endpoints (e.g., /predict) for programmatic access.


Run Notebooks:Open Jupyter notebooks in NoteBooks/ for EDA or model training:
jupyter notebook



Datasets
The DataSets/ folder contains datasets used for training and testing. Example datasets include:

Twitter sentiment datasets
Product review datasets
Custom text corpora

To add new datasets:

Place the dataset in DataSets/.
Update preprocessing scripts in src/ to handle the new dataset.

Notebooks
The NoteBooks/ folder contains Jupyter notebooks for:

EDA: Visualizing dataset statistics (e.g., word clouds, sentiment distribution).
Model Training: Experimenting with models like Logistic Regression, LSTM, or BERT.
Evaluation: Metrics like accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrices.

To run:
cd NoteBooks
jupyter notebook

Backend
The backend (backend.py) is a Flask-based API with endpoints for:

Text Preprocessing: /preprocess (POST)
Sentiment Prediction: /predict (POST)
Model Information: /model-info (GET)

Example API call:
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/predict -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"text": "I love this product!"}'

Frontend
The frontend (frontend.py) is a Streamlit application that:

Provides a text input field for users.
Displays sentiment predictions and confidence scores.
Visualizes results with charts (e.g., sentiment distribution).

Access it via:
streamlit run frontend.py
